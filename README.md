# Random NFT

This is an implementation of NFT, introduction ERC 721 standard. Non-Fungible Tokens represents tokens that are not interchangeable with others.

## Workings

Here we were able to show how to implement the ERC 721 token standard by extending the openzeppelin library which is some sets of contracts that implement some of the ERC standard.

We are also using chainlink VRF to verifiable generate a random number, Which we use to select one of our nft by chance.
